      <h3>How sustainable is your merchandise?</h3>
      <p>As a climate action group, we take sustainability seriously. Our merchandise has been responsibly sourced and is crafted from 100% bio-washed organic cotton. Our products are high-quality and durable for long-term use - take that fast fashion! Additionally, we minimise our transport emissions by consolidating all shipments and dispatching all orders together every week.</p>

      <h3>Can I track my merch? How long does it take to ship?</h3>
      <p>Your package can be tracked through India Post. You will receive the tracking details via email once you’ve completed your donation and we’ve shipped your order. The estimated delivery timeline provided by IndiaPost is 1-5 business days. We ship all orders on one day of the week to minimise our carbon footprint.</p>

      <h3>Is there a return, cancellation, or exchange policy?</h3>
      <p>Yes, we do offer exchanges. While the initial shipping cost is included in the price, you will have to cover any additional shipping costs. If you’d like to exchange your product, please email us at thereisnoearthb@gmail.com. Note: We do not offer returns, refunds, or order cancellations. We also do not accept merchandise returns where the product is damaged. As a grassroots movement, There Is No Earth B is focused on raising funds for our campaigns and climate action efforts, not operating as a traditional online store. The merchandise you receive is a thank-you gift for your donation, not a purchase.</p>
