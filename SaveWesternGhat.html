However, this extremely valuable ecosystem is facing an enormous threat of supposed ‘developmental projects’ by massive deforestation and exploitation of natural resources which can lead to potential disasters.I would like to bring to your attention the following projects being carried forward in the western ghats of India and as a concerned citizen I demand that alternative and more eco-friendly options be taken forth. 1. Sharavathi Valley Pumped-storage Power Plant in Karnataka: The project that according to project proponents’ records requires diversion of 360 acres of forest land could irreversibly alter the rainfall pattern and the river flow which can substantially reduce the water availability for the hydel projects on the river valley. There are important and valid concerns over the fact that this project is situated in the heart of Sharavathi Valley and may require diversion of more than 500 acres of forest land for preconstruction activities and transmission lines ( as reported by Mongabay) are deeply concerning not just for Southern India’s climate but also for the endemic lion-tailed macaque (there are two groups of LTM  at the location where the underground pumped storage is coming up) and vulnerable great Indian hornbill as their existence is threatened. The heavily dammed Sharavathi river already contributes to 40 percent (1,469.2 megawatts) of the total hydropower generation in Karnataka with seven dams and five tunnels and certainly cannot bear any more compromise of its natural flow. Moreover, experts have also expressed concerns on the technical soundness of the project stating that the power plant could end up consuming more energy from the grid than it can generate in a year ( consume about 24 percent more electricity in pumping water from the lower reservoir to the upper reservoir as compared to the electricity it can generate from the same volume of water ) and I do not believe is worthy of the huge ecological as well as economic cost to society, as the project requires allocation of Rs 50 Billion. The Pre-Feasibility Report (PFR) for the project was submitted at a time the project area was adjacent to the Sharavathi reserve but now it is a wildlife sanctuary. India’s Wildlife Protection Act clearly prohibits any kind of destruction of wildlife habitats inside a wildlife sanctuary unless it is for the betterment of wildlife and its habitat which is clearly not the case and this anthropological intervention can cause damage to the fragile ecosystem of the sanctuary. Moreover, this was one of many projects that the NBWL’s standing committee cleared during the COVID-19 lockdown which seems extremely unfair and unethical. 2.Kaiga Nuclear Plant Expansion: The two new proposed nuclear power reactors of the type Pressurised heavy-water reactor (PHWR) of 700 MW capacity will generate a  loss of 54 hectares of forest land near the Kali Tiger Reserve for the 5th and 6th  units of the power plant. In addition to this existing transmission lines (4 lines of 400 kV rating) to evacuate power from Kaiga NPP will not be adequate for the new capacity of 1,400 MW, there will be a need for additional transmission lines to evacuate the generated electricity and the construction of additional accommodation in the existing township in Karnataka’s Karwar taluk in the ecologically fragile Western Ghats. Therefore bringing up the loss of forest land to approximately 120 hectares of forest land for units and transmission lines ( without taking into account the additional accommodation). According to a 2011 report by the Union Ministry of Environment and Forests, these forests are considered to be some of the best tropical forests in the world with very high ecological value, rich tropical bio-diversity, many kinds of unique species, and are also considered as the backbone of the ecology and economy of South India. They are also very good carbon sequestration systems in addition to being the water fountains of Peninsular India. The total cost (both direct and indirect costs) of such a destruction of tropical forests is very high from the ecological perspective to India, whereas the benefits of the additional electricity from the expanded project will be negligible from the country’s projected power sector capability by 2030. Another concern is that due to the increased volume of the used-water discharge from the project, the pollution level of the river water downstream of the project is likely to go up, despite the claims of project authorities on water purification processes to be deployed.  In 2009, the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) confirmed that radioactive tritium was deliberately mixed in the water at the plant, exposing about 50 workers to a high dose of radiation. In addition to the environmental concerns, the impact of the vastly increased radiation density on the bio-diversity and the people working and living in the project area cannot be anything but negative. Additionally, the risk of any unfortunate nuclear accident can only multiply because of the need to store on-site the vastly additional quantity of highly radioactive spent fuel for hundreds of years. Instances of cancer tripled in three years in Karwar taluka, according to a 2010-2013 study by Tata Memorial Centre. A  note from the Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF-CC) mandated an assessment of how a new thermal power plant could affect human health and the environment as necessary to get environmental clearances (EC). However, the EC for Kaiga was granted decades ago and hence, this note for a risk assessment may not affect the functioning of the expanded plant at all.  There is a general consensus linked to the expansion of the project that puts forth the notion that many locals are happy with the project due to the probable increase in employment however locals have protested for years against the nuclear plant expressing their concerns over the water pollution affecting water resources and agriculture and increased prevalence of cancer such as in November 2011. Another source of contention is the nuclear plant’s overdependence on water. Once functional, the two expanded units will consume 7,500 cubic metres of water per hour, this water could instead be used by 15 lakh people as stated by Shankar Sharma, a power policy analyst. Over 8,700 trees will face the axe for the project and although compensatory afforestation has been advised, even with afforestation measures taken, the forest’s carbon sink and the forest cannot be adequately restored. Any further loss of such rich forests in the Western Ghats can spell doom not only to the drought-prone state of Karnataka but to the whole of Peninsular India. 3.Yettinahole stream diversion project: The construction of the Yettinahole River Diversion Project proposed by Karnataka Neeravari Nigam Limited (KNNL), aims to divert the flow of Yettinahole, a vital tributary of the Nethravathi river towards water-scarce districts of Kolar, Hassan, Tumkur, Chikkaballapur, Bengaluru Rural. Although the objective of this project is in good faith to reduce water scarcity and the people affected by it, it does just the opposite of that and increases the risk of long term water scarcity. A 2016 report by the Indian Institute of Science prepared by a team of researchers led by TV Ramachandra had questioned the amount of water in catchment areas of the Yettinahole that would be available for diversion. It had contended that only 9.5 TMC of water will be available even in monsoon months, which is far less than the 24 TMC estimated by the government. The catchment areas of the project – namely Kadagarahalli, Hiradanahalli, Hebbasale, Heggade and Maranahalli. These areas were blasted during the project implementation stage and there is no sign of water, and  the blasting activities have had a major impact on the ecologically sensitive Western Ghats.  Karnataka Neeravari Nigam Ltd that was first tasked with implementing the project and VJNL now implementing the project have both admitted there is no surplus water available at Yettinahole that can be diverted for potable use. “The construction of the Yettinahole project has led to drying up of water sources in the Nethravathi river. This is in spite of declaring Dakshina Kannada district as drought-hit last year. There is drinking water scarcity and the government has admitted this region is drought hit and yet the project is going ahead” as stated by Dinesh Holla in an interview. The recent floods in Madikeri district and Kerala ring a warning bell for pursuing any alterations to the ecology of the Western Ghats and rivers in particular. Understanding the river hydrology and floodplains, which form diverse habitats for flora and fauna, can go a long way in arriving at sustainable solutions. Time and again, ecologists have raised concerns against river linking and the threats it can cause to larger ecosystems. An intra-district water conflict had also simmered: with the coastal districts believing the project will impact River Nethravati (four of its tributaries are being diverted), affect fisheries and cause irreparable damage to forests and Western Ghats bio-diversity.Development goals should be evolved locally, and the water demands should be assessed at watershed levels. Furthermore, studies done by the IISc have shown that the available water from Yettinahole may not reach Kolar and Chikkaballapur as planned. Dr. T V Ramachandra, head of Energy and Wetland Research Group, IISc said that “The project has already caused a big dent to the green cover in the Ghats and pipeline laying has also destroyed several patches of green cover in the region. The mud that has been extracted from the work site will now go and sit under river beds when the rains begin,” he said. By the time the project is finished (an estimated three years time) the implementation cost may escalate. In the last four years, a large amount of money has been sunk into the project, leaving heaps of mud dumped across the sensitive Western Ghats. The particular part of the Ghats, which falls in Sakleshpur of Hassan district, is home to several streams that feed the river Netravati, the lifeline of coastal districts in Karnataka. More water scarcity in these regions will only cause an ecological crisis, as well as poverty, unemployment, and people may lose their livelihoods. I would also like to bring your attention to other projects happening in the Western Ghats that could potentially be the doom of the ecologically rich area such as the increased deforestation due to several highway expansion projects ( such as Mangaluru- Chitradurga Inter-Corridor Project and more) and transmission lines ( such as power transmission line to Goa from Chattisgarh through Dandeli Wildlife Sanctuary and the project by The Goa Tamnar Transmission Project Ltd spread across state of Goa, Karnataka and Chattisgarh and passing through the heavy dense forest of the Western Ghats in Goa and Karnataka. According to a study by the researchers of the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bengaluru and Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kharagpur, the forest cover in Uttara Kannada has reduced from 74.19 percent in 1973 to 48.04 percent in 2018, with loss of evergreen forests dropping from 56.07 percent to 24.85 percent. The loss of forest cover stated in the study is owing to activities such as the construction of dams along the Kali river after 1975 without appropriate rehabilitation measures. In addition to this as against the National Forest Policy (adopted in the 1980s) target of 33 percent land cover by forests and trees, Karnataka’s forest and tree cover at present is less than 20 percent. A study has noted that during the last 40 years about 64,355 hectares of forest land has been diverted for various non-forestry activities. As per the record, 80 percent of the Uttara Kannada area is supposed to be forest land but the shrinking forest cover and an increase in such projects can disturb nature’s equilibrium, some parts of the state have water deficiency and other parts have recently had unexpected fears of floods. Uttara Kannada district is among the eight biodiversity hotspots in India and hosts many species of flora and fauna. The natural forests are home to species of more than 4,600 flowering plants (38 percent endemic), 330 butterflies (11 percent endemic), 156 reptiles (62 percent endemic), 508 birds (4 percent endemic), 120 mammals (12 percent endemic), 289 fishes (41 percent endemic) and 135 amphibians (75 percent endemic). Even the Supreme Court in 2013 noted that Western Ghats region is one of the richest biodiversity areas which needs to be conserved. Surely you understand the gravity of the situation through this email. Sincerely, Concerned Earthling and Citizen. `;">
