The report revealed that landfilling at the 33-hectare Metro car-shed site in Aarey Colony altered the natural course of the Mithi river. As per Dr Sawant: The construction of this car shed will be a catastrophe not just for trees, but the floodplains of Mithi and the entire biodiversity of Aarey.

The report revealed that landfilling at the 33-hectare Metro car-shed site in Aarey Colony altered the natural course of the Mithi river.

The report revealed that landfilling at the 33-hectare Metro car-shed site in Aarey Colony altered the natural course of the Mithi river. As per Dr Sawant: The construction of this car shed will be a catastrophe not just for trees, but the floodplains of Mithi and the entire biodiversity of Aarey.

The report revealed that landfilling at the 33-hectare Metro car-shed site in Aarey Colony altered the natural course of the Mithi river. As per Dr Sawant: The construction of this car shed will be a catastrophe not just for trees, but the floodplains of Mithi and the entire biodiversity of Aarey.

Many of these tribals have been residing there since before the 1949 establishment of the Aarey Milk Colony and have themselves grown, nurtured and preserved the green lungs of Mumbai for decades, if not centuries.

A qualitative study using maps showed how Aarey lost its green cover periodically since the late 1940s. The study by KRVIA, Mumbai, reported only 800 of 1,300 hectares of Aarey, originally allocated as No Development Zone will remain as a Green Zone leading to a loss of approximately 40% original area due to ongoing and proposed construction activities which is a matter of grave concern since it will badly disrupt the ecological equilibrium. Public and private projects are likely to sever the contiguity with Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP) affecting wildlife movement, disrupting hydrological processes and the natural drainage pattern of the green lung, the report said. The Mumbai Metro 3 car depot is yet another project that is evidently destructive to the ecosystem of the city and will only worsen the threat Aarey faces. It is highly flawed and has completely disregarded some crucial points as stated below:</p><o5><li>LOSS OF BIODIVERSITY and FOREST COVER</li></o5><p>MMRCL s choice of land for this project has not taken into account the harm the biodiversity would face. </p><p>The area of Aarey forest harbors 45 species of mammals, 43 species of reptiles, 300 species of birds and 150 species of butterflies. Even though the EIA report for the MML-3 project states that there is no wildlife in the concerned area, a leopard was photographed sitting on a hillock right next to the Metro car depot site. In fact, according to a list submitted to the IUCN, the area has more than 290 wild species of flora and fauna, such as leopard and rusty-spotted cats (classified as vulnerable).

Experts say the relocation of mature trees requires adequate planning, engineering techniques as well as resources. The metro rail agency had transplanted a total of 5,443 trees, of which 2,644 have shown no signs of sprouting and only 284 of the 400 saplings planted by MMRC had survived. </p><p><br /><br /></p><o2><li>LOSS OF AIR PURIFICATION</li></o2><p>Aarey is also the citys largest natural air purifier without which the citys population will suffer from higher risks of respiratory diseases, largely impairing the physical as well as mental health of the masses.

The report revealed that landfilling at the 33-hectare Metro car-shed site in Aarey Colony altered the natural course of the Mithi river. As per Dr Sawant: The construction of this car shed will be a catastrophe not just for trees, but the floodplains of Mithi and the entire biodiversity of Aarey.

The report revealed that landfilling at the 33-hectare Metro car-shed site in Aarey Colony altered the natural course of the Mithi river. As per Dr Sawant: The construction of this car shed will be a catastrophe not just for trees, but the floodplains of Mithi and the entire biodiversity of Aarey.

The report revealed that landfilling at the 33-hectare Metro car-shed site in Aarey Colony altered the natural course of the Mithi river.

The report revealed that landfilling at the 33-hectare Metro car-shed site in Aarey Colony altered the natural course of the Mithi river. As per Dr Sawant: The construction of this car shed will be a catastrophe not just for trees, but the floodplains of Mithi and the entire biodiversity of Aarey.

The report revealed that landfilling at the 33-hectare Metro car-shed site in Aarey Colony altered the natural course of the Mithi river.

The report revealed that landfilling at the 33-hectare Metro car-shed site in Aarey Colony altered the natural course of the Mithi river. As per Dr Sawant: The construction of this car shed will be a catastrophe not just for trees, but the floodplains of Mithi and the entire biodiversity of Aarey.

The report revealed that landfilling at the 33-hectare Metro car-shed site in Aarey Colony altered the natural course of the Mithi river. As per Dr Sawant: The construction of this car shed will be a catastrophe not just for trees, but the floodplains of Mithi and the entire biodiversity of Aarey.

A qualitative study using maps showed how Aarey lost its green cover periodically since the late 1940s. The study by KRVIA, Mumbai, reported only 800 of 1,300 hectares of Aarey, originally allocated as No Development Zone will remain as a Green Zone leading to a loss of approximately 40% original area due to ongoing and proposed construction activities which is a matter of grave concern since it will badly disrupt the ecological equilibrium. Public and private projects are likely to sever the contiguity with Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP) affecting wildlife movement, disrupting hydrological processes and the natural drainage pattern of the green lung, the report said. The Mumbai Metro 3 car depot is yet another project that is evidently destructive to the ecosystem of the city and will only worsen the threat Aarey faces. It is highly flawed and has completely disregarded some crucial points as stated below:</p><o5><li>LOSS OF BIODIVERSITY and FOREST COVER</li></o5><p>MMRCL s choice of land for this project has not taken into account the harm the biodiversity would face. </p><p>The area of Aarey forest harbors 45 species of mammals, 43 species of reptiles, 300 species of birds and 150 species of butterflies. Even though the EIA report for the MML-3 project states that there is no wildlife in the concerned area, a leopard was photographed sitting on a hillock right next to the Metro car depot site. In fact, according to a list submitted to the IUCN, the area has more than 290 wild species of flora and fauna, such as leopard and rusty-spotted cats (classified as vulnerable). New species of scorpions and spiders were also discovered here. Two are even named after the colony - Heterophrictus aareyeneis (tarantula) and Lychas aareyensis (scorpion).</p><p>Apart from this, the area is a heavily forested land that boasts of trees of about a hundred indigenous forest species and 1,300 species of flowering plants. Despite the area having heavy tree cover MMRCL has claimed otherwise.</p><p>Rich flora and fauna like that of Aarey takes hundreds of years to develop and must not be curbed in the name of development that may ultimately cause irreparable damage. Although the damage already caused by the felling of over 2,100 trees can not be reversed, the area can and should still be protected from further destruction.</p><p>We would also like to point out that this is entirely contradictory to the Nagar Van Scheme launched by the Centre this Environment Day, the objective of which is to attempt to create forests to provide cleaner air for urban areas. </p><p>Although MMRC has promised rigorous tree planting of six times the trees being felled and transplantation of 461 trees, according to BMC in September 2019 it was revealed that 48 percent of the trees transplanted by MMRC since January 2018 have died. Experts say the relocation of mature trees requires adequate planning, engineering techniques as well as resources. The metro rail agency had transplanted a total of 5,443 trees, of which 2,644 have shown no signs of sprouting and only 284 of the 400 saplings planted by MMRC had survived. </p><p><br /><br /></p><o2><li>LOSS OF AIR PURIFICATION</li></o2><p>Aarey is also the citys largest natural air purifier without which the citys population will suffer from higher risks of respiratory diseases, largely impairing the physical as well as mental health of the masses.
