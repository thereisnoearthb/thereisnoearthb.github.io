These are practices of animal cruelty. In a country where dogs are traded as domestic pets, used in the Police Department, used as therapy animals, etc, our nation must reconsider the brutal plight we exhibit on the canines. </p><p>I write to you as an animal lover a compassionate human being and urge you to look into the matter. </p><p><strong>From a legal Point Of View</strong></p><p>The <strong>Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 </strong>and <strong>Wildlife (Protection) Act</strong>, make provisions which protect stray dogs against cruelty and <strong>Stray Dog Management Rules, 2001</strong> makes it <strong>illegal to remove or relocate dogs</strong> from their territory.</p><p>According to https://www.instagram.com/p/CCDYxgtnDIP/ , https://www.indiatvnews.com/news/india-nagaland-s-death-pits-for-dogs-beaten-to-death-meat-339429 and https://easternmirrornagaland.com/maneka-gandhi-targets-dog-meat-sale/ both these things are happening in Dimapur.</p><p><strong>Under section 429 indian penal code whoever commits mischief by killing, poisoning, maiming or rendering useless any animal must be held accountable.</strong></p><p>Because stray dogs are living creatures, as well as wildlife, they come within the purview of Article 51A(g). And from the discussions above, it is clear that the rights of stray dogs include the following:</p><p>(i) Right to be protected</p><p>(ii) Right to be shown compassion, is constitutionally guaranteed</p><p>(iii) Right to be free from all forms of cruelty</p><p>Sources: https://www.lawnn.com/stray-dogs/p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CCDYxgtnDIP/</p><p>https://easternmirrornagaland.com/maneka-gandhi-targets-dog-meat-sale/</p><p><br /><br /></p><p><strong>From a vegan standpoint</strong></p><ol><li>With the rise of animal activism in the world where compassionate human beings are giving up speciesism, which the society and rituals conditioned everyone to believe as normal, people are starting to recognise the plight of thousands of sentient earthlings who are killed mercilessly every minute to satisfy the taste palate of the most evolved species on earth, for a few seconds. As the vegan movement is gaining momentum for talking openly about the cruelty inflicted on animals in factory farms which are effectively hidden from the eyes of its end consumers, a number of people are giving up the consumption of socially sanctioned meat like chicken, pork, beef, lamb, etc. </li><li>An argument in support of dog meat consumption states that it is hypocritical to ban meat consumption of one animal, just because as it is the one of the most petted animals in the world, while people go on consuming the meat of other equally intelligent animals like pig and cow. I see the paradox here and hence, say, that while vegans all over the world are fighting to free these socially normalised animals raised in inhumane environments for their meat, it is important to not let people add another animal on the list. This will not only normalise the suffering of these beings who feel pain as well, but also make the battle of establishing animal rights more difficult. </li></ol><p><br />https://youtu.be/yqSmYCBQths (1:39 minutes- Can you watch the video without gagging or feeling a pit in your stomach due to the disgust that this imagery creates?)</p><p> https://youtu.be/WaVPaC51O7w (1:37 minutes- To see the inhumane conditions in which dogs are kept in with their bodies tightly strapped in a sack and their mouth closed shut with a string.)</p><p><strong>From a public health standpoint</strong></p><ol><li>As opposed to the common conception about dog meat and how it is iron rich, helps to keep one warm in winters and has high proteins, what the other side prevails can have direct, serious impact on people ’s health and development of terminal diseases. Consumption of unsanitized dog flesh and organs has been known to cause <strong>rabies, trichinosis, cholera and hypervitaminosis A</strong>. As the sale of dog meat is not regularised by authorities and is generally made available by catching street dogs that are exposed to a number of contaminants, it cannot be assured if the meat being sold is hygienic and safe to eat. </li><li>Along with this, another common way in which dog meat is sourced, is by poisoning pet dogs which can enter a human ’s bloodstream and have fatal effects. </li><li>The question to ask oneself is, <strong>do we want another COVID 19 like outbreak in the world</strong> because we can ’t keep ourselves from eating anything that lives? In case you think that this practice has been around for decades now hence, nothing will happen, I urge you to think think about after how and when did swine flu, mad cow disease, ebola virus, HIV, SARS and even COVID 19 emerge. </li></ol><p>https://english.cambodiadaily.com/news/fifth-person-dies-after-eating-poisoned-dog-102466/ (Reports on human death after eating dog meat)</p><p>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7961739/Millions-rabies-infected-dogs-slaughtered-meat-drowning-pits-Cambodia.html (Cambodia and the rabies crisis)</p><p>https://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2020/may/17/amid-covid-pandemic-centre-urged-to-stop-trade-of-dog-cat-meat-2144555.html</a> (Risks of eating dog meat)</p><p>Sincerely </p><p>An animal Lover and Compassionate Citizen</p>';">
